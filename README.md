In this project, i have taken 2019 airbnb data for analysis. It includes exloring, filtering and cleaning of the data, by deleting any duplicates and filled the missing and na values. For this i have used pandas dataframe.

Next step i have framed 13 question that needed to be answered through this project which are interlinked with most price, place and their affects on availability and any pattern in these variables.

I have calculated and visualized them for better understanding for which i  have used seaborn and matplotlib for visualization.
